Diagnosis Module.

1.  Malaria Diagnosis.
  (Clinical Diagnosis ) First Symptoms
Fever, Chills, Sweats, Headaches, Muscle pain, Nausea and Vomiting.

    Clinical Findings
Confusion, Coma, Neurological Focal Signs, Severe Anaemia, Respiratory difficulties.
To be confirmed by a laboratory test for Malaria.

2. Dengue Diagnosis.

(Laboratory Diagnosis)

Isolation of the virus, using serological tests or molecular methods.

(Dengue Without Warning Signs)
Fever, Nausea, Vomiting, Rash, Aches and pains, Leukopenia, Positive Tourniquet test.
(Dengue With Warning Signs)
Severe Dengue
Persistent vomiting, Clinical Fluid Accumulation(ascites, pleural effusion), Mucosal Bleeding, Lethargy, restlessness, Liver enlargement

3.  African Sleeping Sickness

intermittent fevers, Headaches, Muscle and Joint aches, and Malaise. Itching of the skin, swollen lymph nodes, and Weight loss
(Laboratory Diagnosis)
Finding parasite in body fluid or tissue by microscopy examination.
Cerebrospinal fluid examination as choice of treatment depends on disease stage.

4.  Yellow Fever

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on laboratory testing, a person’s symptoms, and travel history

Symptoms
Sudden onset of fever, Chills, Severe headache, Back pain, General body aches
Nausea, Vomiting, Fatigue (feeling tired), Weakness
Most people with the initial symptoms improve within one week.
For some people who recover, weakness and fatigue (feeling tired) might last several month

5.  Zika Fever.

Diagnosis
Infection with Zika virus may be suspected based on symptoms of persons living in or visiting areas with Zika virus transmission and/or Aedes mosquito vectors.
A diagnosis of Zika virus infection can only be confirmed by laboratory tests of blood or other body fluids, such as urine or semen.

6. Chikungunya.

Diagnosis
Several methods can be used for diagnosis. Serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), may confirm the presence of IgM and IgG anti-chikungunya antibodies. IgM antibody levels are highest 3 to 5 weeks after the onset of illness and persist for about 2 months.
 Samples collected during the first week after the onset of symptoms should be tested by both serological and virological methods (RT-PCR).
The virus may be isolated from the blood during the first few days of infection.
 Various reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) methods are available but are of variable sensitivity. Some are suited to clinical diagnosis. RT–PCR products from clinical samples may also be used for genotyping of the virus, allowing comparisons with virus samples from various geographical sources.
